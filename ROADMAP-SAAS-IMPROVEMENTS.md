# Accelerated SaaS Roadmap (Non-Payment/AI Focus)

This roadmap focuses on increasing **User Retention**, **Platform Trust**, and **Operational Efficiency**.

## 🛡️ Phase 1: Trust & Verification (Crucial for Marketplace)
*Goal: Remove fear of scams and increase professional quality.*

1.  **Tiered Verification System**:
    *   **Level 1 (Email/Phone)**: Basic access.
    *   **Level 2 (Identity)**: Upload KTP/KTM (Students) or NIB (UMKM). Grants "Verified" badge.
    *   **Level 3 (Skill/Business)**: Portfolio review or Business verification. Grants "Pro" badge.
2.  **Endorsement System**:
    *   Allow Clients to endorse specific skills (e.g., "Good Communication", "Figma Expert") after a project, not just a star rating.
3.  **Report & Dispute Resolution**:
    *   "Report User/Project" button.
    *   Basic admin interface to handle disputes before they escalate.

## 🤝 Phase 2: Project Workspace & Collaboration
*Goal: Make QuickTurn the place where work *happens*, not just where it's found.*

1.  **Dedicated Project Workspace**:
    *   Transform "Active Project" from a simple status into a full dashboard.
    *   **Kanban Board**: Simple "To Do", "In Progress", "Done" board shared between Client & Talent.
    *   **File Repository**: Dedicated tab for Briefs, Assets, and Deliverables (separate from chat).
2.  **Milestone Tracking**:
    *   Allow breaking a project into 2-3 milestones with due dates (e.g., "Draft 1", "Final Revision").
3.  **Automated Reminders**:
    *   "Task due in 24h" email/notification for Talents.
    *   "Review needed" reminder for Clients.

## 🏆 Phase 3: Gamification & Engagement
*Goal: Add "sticky" features that make users want to come back daily.*

1.  **Gamification Engine**:
    *   **XP & Levels**: Earn XP for logging in, applying, and completing jobs.
    *   **Badges**: "Early Adopter", "Fast Responder", "Project Finisher".
    *   **Leaderboards**: "Top Student of the Month" (displayed on landing page).
    *   **Streaks**: "7-Day Login Streak" bonus (e.g., priority application).
2.  **Community Hub**:
    *   Simple forum or "Discussion" board for Students to share tips or ask questions.

## ⚡ Phase 4: Technical & UX Polish
*Goal: World-class user experience.*

1.  **PWA (Progressive Web App)**:
    *   Make the site installable on Android/iOS (Add to Homescreen).
    *   Offline support for viewing cached projects.
2.  **SEO Optimization**:
    *   Generate dynamic `sitemap.xml`.
    *   Add `meta` tags for Twitter Cards/OpenGraph so project links look good when shared on WhatsApp/Twitter.
3.  **Dark Mode**:
    *   Toggle for dark theme (highly requested by developers/designers).
4.  **Onboarding Tour**:
    *   Interactive walkthrough (`react-joyride`) for new users explaining the dashboard.
